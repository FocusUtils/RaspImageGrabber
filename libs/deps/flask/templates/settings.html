                <br><p>Hint: watch out for the pins being in order that the motor needs to rotate. In case that the direction is flipped, just enter the numbers in inverse order! There also need to be at least 3 pins (phases), but that should be given by the steppermotor you are using!</p>

                    Confirm and test (The Camera should trigger once. (The resistance should drop heavily over the output in case you are using my circuit, but the voltage should remain, with the camera disconnected, very close to 0!))

                <br><p>Hint: You are responsible for your own equipment and I will not cover any damage caused neither to the raspberry nor your camera. I strongly advise to measure resistance and voltage on your output cable! The default on option is still buggy with a GPIO connected camera, the testing doesn't always provide the expected result!</p>
